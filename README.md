# fire_detection

Aim of this project is to develop a deep learning model to detect early fire on a edge device for laser machine applications.

It has been achieved through below steps.
1. Used VGG16 pre-model and added extra layers.
2. Converted tf model to tflite model to deploy on Raaspberry PI.
